# CPP_Assignment_Submission
This is my submission for the CPP assignment.<br/>
You should be able to clone this repo and directly use it.<br/>
There are hardcoded paths in some of the code, please ensure that the .csv and .txt file are in a directory directly accessible by the python environment without need for path (most likely the location of .ipynb file).
